### Phaser Parcel Boilerplate

Just a simple Phaser boilerplate using [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/) bundler.

##### Usage:

Clone the repo to your desired location. Then execute the following commands:

* Go into the folder you have cloned it into 

```bash
cd {folder_name}
```

* Run npm install to install the dev dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

* Run parcel and create a server using the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

That's it, if you head to [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234), you will be greeted with the StartScene.

Have fun creating, and good luck! 😎☕️
